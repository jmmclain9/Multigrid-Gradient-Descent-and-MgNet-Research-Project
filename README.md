# Multigrid-Gradient-Descent-and-MgNet-Research-Project

This repo contains code used for my undergraduate research in multigrid methods for deep learning.
I'd encourage starting with 'Multigrid_vs_FEM_GD_for_Numerical_Analysis.ipynb' before exploring the rest of the code, since I define the problem statement and formalize the underlying mathematics in that notebook.
